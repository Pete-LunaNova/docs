There are several options available to manage your NEAR and NEAR-based assets. This list is regularly updated as more products and providers offer NEAR support.

## Web Wallets

- ### NEAR Wallet

  - The [NEAR Web Wallet](http://wallet.near.org) is the easiest way to get started on NEAR. If you have an allocation of NEAR tokens, ask your facilitator (CoinList or the NEAR Foundation) to send you a NEAR Drop and follow [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13b3K_9f0YZudFrEAmagM4RcesK3DFxPBE5DswJ37Das). 
  - NEAR Wallet also supports Ledger hardware devices for improved security.

- ### Mobile Wallets

  - [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) is a very popular, non-custodial, wallet available on iOS and Android.

## CLI (Recommended for developers and validators)

  - ### Ledger via CLI 
      - For users with advanced security requirements and the need for flexibility (developers and validators), we highly recommend using our command line interface [(NEAR-CLI)](https://docs.near.org/docs/development/near-cli) with a Ledger hardware device.
      - This [community-authored guide](https://medium.com/@bonsfi/how-to-use-ledger-with-near-cli-648d5d990517) walks through several common commands

  - ### Ledger Live
      - You can install the NEAR Ledger app in [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) by:
        1) Open Ledger Live and install any available firmware updates
        2) Go to `Settings`
        3) Under `Experimental Features` ensure `Developer Mode` is switched on
        4) Return to the `Manager` tab and search for NEAR
        5) Follow instructions to install the NEAR app on your device
