There are several options available to manage your NEAR and NEAR-based assets. This list is regularly updated as more products and providers offer NEAR support.

## Web Wallets

- ### NEAR Wallet

  - The [NEAR Web Wallet](http://wallet.near.org) is the easiest way to get started on NEAR. If you have an allocation of NEAR tokens, ask your facilitator (CoinList, the NEAR Foundation) to send you a NEAR Drop, and follow [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13b3K_9f0YZudFrEAmagM4RcesK3DFxPBE5DswJ37Das).
